# sql-challenge
QuickDBD diagram is created and screenshot added to the EmployeeSQL folder.
For dept_emp and dept_manager tables, a combination of PKs are used, because neither of the columns has a unique values(the first table has multiple same values for both columns and the second table has incomplete list of employees).
QuickDBD-export-5.sql file with the tables creation code is provided in the EmployeeSQL folder.
After running the code and creating the tables, all the tables were imported. 
EmployeeSQL_final.sql file with all 8 queries is also included in the EmployeeSQL folder.
Query_results folder contains 8 query results screenshots with the tables.
